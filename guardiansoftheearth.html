        <h1>Don't Give Up!</h1>
        <p1>You and your team of heroes were able to overpower the most sinister villains, but they managed to outsmart you all and were able to predict all of your attacks quickly and with no time to lose. They managed to defeat you and your team, leaving you all weak and injured. But the balle is far from over... You may have lost this time... but next time will be the real thing!</p1>

            <p>Hint: Fighting as a team is more to it then just having strength and upgrades. If your enemies are able to outsmart you... Then maybe you should use their own strategy against themselves.</p>
