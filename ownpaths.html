        <h1>GAME OVER: Hero Let Down...</h1>
        <p>You and your "team" went after the villains and failed... Seems like all of you were fighting on their own and the villains managed to outsmart you and your coup and won the fight. The world will soon become nothing but a dark age of living nightmares! All hope is lost...</p>

        <p>Hint: You may be a hero, but that doesn't mean that you can manage to withhold the most sinister villains without a plan or a counter attack. If you work together with your team, all of you can overpower more than one villain at the same time. When one is weak, another is still strong and able to finish the job.</p>
