        <h1>Heroes Collide!</h1>
        <p>Seems like the villains are much stronger than expected. Your gonna need all the help you need to take down these villains. You managed to recruit some heroes who have defended the innocent in their own ways. They seem to do well working alone, but now is the time for heroes to join forces and bring evil to justice and save all of human and robot kind. As the leader of this team of heroes, what will your orders be?</p>
